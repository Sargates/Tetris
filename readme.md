# Tetris
Just a Tetris project I whipped up over the course of a week.

## Requirements:
Python 3.10+ (for match cases)\
[Pygame module for Python](https://www.pygame.org/) (Does not work using [Pygame-ce](https://pyga.me/), I do not know why)

## Controls:
LEFT/RIGHT for left/right movement of the active piece\
UP/Z for clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation\
DOWN to step the active piece down one cell\
C to hold active piece\
SPACE to drop piece to bottom\
ESC for pause
